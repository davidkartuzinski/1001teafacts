So that makes it ideal to have after dinner to balance the PH of your mouth, neutralize bacteria and freshen up your breath!

Do you want to experiment with ginger tea? I suggest you start with yogi ginger tea or if you are a loose tea lover try making your ginger tea with dried ginger root. Ginger tea tastes amazing as it is but I highly recommend adding a bit of mint or chamomile in it and for sweetener nothing beats a good honey.
